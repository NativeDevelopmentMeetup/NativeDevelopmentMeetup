**David Kovacs (Supercharge): Building highly customizable iOS applications on top of a core codebase**

Creating well packaged, reusable code is not easy in itself but when it comes to large components of an application - from the UI to integration - this becomes quite a challenge. We have recently built a large, multi-country self-care application that will serve as a good case study. I'll speak about how we've solved different problems along the way to create a core codebase that can be easily tailored for special client needs.

Agenda:

- Challenges  
- Our solution  
- Collaborating on the core  
- Testing / CI / QA / Release

**Mate Herber (Skyscanner): How Kotlin can change Android development**

While Android development using Java is perfectly fine and you can achieve everything you want, it's expressiveness leaves a lot to be desired. While Java 8 has a lot of cool features, android developers stuck somewhere between 6 and 7. Having no word about the future of Android development from Google, Kotlin seems to solve a lot of issues an android developer faces every day and also brings clean code to the table. Doing all these in a 100% Java interoperable way. Even though we don't use Kotlin yet at Skyscanner, I'd like to make everybody excited about Kotlin by showcasing some of its features through an Android dev's eye.

- Introducing Kotlin  
- Why Kotlin can be relevant for Android
- What makes Kotlin better (syntax vs Java)
- What makes Kotlin the best (language features)
- Kotlin goodies for Android

**Peter Bardos (Prezi): Evolution of asynchronous processing and parallelization in .NET**

Although .NET is just 13 years old, in the last couple years there were a lot of changes in how we deal with parallelism and asynchronicity. New techniques are making it easy, to deal with these tricky situations, but some of us still has to work with legacy code, and has no chance to deep dive into these cool technologies. Therefore, I'll give a brief overview about the existing framework solutions.

Main points:

- Scheduling
- Overview of threading patterns
- Overview of asynchronous patterns
