**Péter Bálint, VIPER architecture** 
This talk is a high level overview about a software architecture called VIPER. With some clever abstractions and simple rules a healthy and maintainable codebase can be developed. We all know that there is no such thing as a silver bullet so he would like to highlight a couple of downfalls also. Some thoughts about testing will also be covered. He will share his experience with us based on two existing projects in production.

**János Murvai-Gaál (Epam), ReactiveX & Rx.NET** 
Reactive Extensions built upon the observer pattern to process data/event sequence asynchronously which popularity is growing nowadays not only for .net devs but for JavaScript, Java, Android, Scala, Python, etc. They used this library on several projects successfully so he'd like to share his experience and some samples on this talk. He will cover topics like data push model, observer pattern at a glance, cold/hot observables, ObserveOn/SubscribeOn, Rx samples and how to process huge amount of data arriving from sensors.

**Csaba Szigeti (LogMeIn), join.me for Apple Watch** 
They have recently added Apple Watch support to the join.me iOS app. He would like to concentrate on some of the real life problems instead of the basics and share some ready-to-apply solutions bundled with them. He would like to help us avoid a lot of headaches and head-scratching and tell us how to save a lot of time.
