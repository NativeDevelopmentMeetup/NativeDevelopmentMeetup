**Gábor Bakos (Skyscanner), What's new in Android 6.0 and what to do to ensure your application's well being**
As the Android 6.0 release draws near we need to prepare our applications for the new platform. There are couple of new framework possibilities that could render our application to an unintended behaviour or even crash it easily. My talk will focus on use cases and implementation best practices rather than feature introductions. We’ll touch the new Permission model and framework, Doze, App Standby and the Auto backup functionality.

**Viktor Belényesi (Prezi), Yet Another Reactive Framework for iOS**
There are mature (3 years old :-) frameworks with ~10.000 stars and ~6000 commits on GitHub...

Does it make any sense to create a new one?
In what way can Swift - especially 2.x - help us?
What could we improve?

One thing for sure: the Developer Experience! I believe in simplicity and I’m curious how far we can push it using a state of the art language.
